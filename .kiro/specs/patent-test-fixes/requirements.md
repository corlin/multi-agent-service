# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical test failures in the patent system test suite. The failures span multiple areas including data model validation, agent coordination, API endpoints, and data processing. The goal is to systematically fix these issues to ensure the patent system functions correctly and all tests pass.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Patent Data Model Validation Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want patent data models to properly validate input data, so that the system can handle both string and object inputs for applicants and inventors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating PatentData with string applicants THEN the system SHALL convert strings to PatentApplicant objects
2. WHEN creating PatentData with string inventors THEN the system SHALL convert strings to PatentInventor objects  
3. WHEN PatentData has missing ipc_classes attribute THEN the system SHALL handle the missing attribute gracefully
4. WHEN validating patent data with short abstracts THEN the system SHALL accept abstracts with minimum 5 characters
5. WHEN validating application numbers THEN the system SHALL accept numbers with minimum 3 characters

### Requirement 2: Fix Patent Coordinator Agent Issues

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the patent coordinator agent to properly handle requests and coordinate between agents, so that multi-agent workflows execute successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the coordinator SHALL properly access request_id attribute from request objects
2. WHEN coordinating data collection THEN the coordinator SHALL return success status with proper data structure
3. WHEN coordinating search enhancement THEN the coordinator SHALL return enhanced_data with cnki_data and bocha_data
4. WHEN coordinating analysis THEN the coordinator SHALL return analysis results with trend, tech, and competition data
5. WHEN coordinating report generation THEN the coordinator SHALL return report with html_content, pdf_content, and charts
6. WHEN managing workflow state THEN the coordinator SHALL properly track and update workflow status
7. WHEN executing parallel tasks THEN the coordinator SHALL handle concurrent execution correctly
8. WHEN aggregating results THEN the coordinator SHALL have _aggregate_results method available

### Requirement 3: Fix Patent API Integration Issues

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want patent API endpoints to function correctly, so that I can download reports and access patent data through the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting report download THEN the API SHALL return FileResponse object
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return proper HTTP status codes
3. WHEN file downloads are requested THEN the system SHALL generate and serve files correctly

### Requirement 4: Fix Patent Data Processing Issues

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want patent data processing to work correctly, so that I can deduplicate datasets and validate data quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deduplicating patent datasets THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate entries and return correct count
2. WHEN validating patent datasets THEN the system SHALL properly validate all required fields
3. WHEN processing patent data THEN the system SHALL handle validation errors gracefully

### Requirement 5: Fix Patent Agent Initialization and Processing

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want patent agents to initialize and process requests correctly, so that the multi-agent system functions as designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing DataSourceManager THEN it SHALL accept proper constructor arguments
2. WHEN agents process requests THEN they SHALL return 'completed' status for successful operations
3. WHEN agents encounter errors THEN they SHALL return 'failed' status with error details
4. WHEN agents use caching THEN they SHALL properly initialize cached data objects
5. WHEN agents evaluate quality THEN they SHALL return scores above minimum thresholds
6. WHEN agents handle concurrent operations THEN they SHALL execute successfully in parallel

### Requirement 6: Fix Patent Report and Search Agent Issues

**User Story:** As a patent researcher, I want report and search agents to generate proper outputs, so that I can access comprehensive patent analysis reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Report objects are created THEN they SHALL include all required parameters (pdf_content, charts)
2. WHEN PatentAnalysisRequest is used THEN it SHALL have report_format attribute available
3. WHEN EnhancedData objects are created THEN they SHALL include academic_data and web_intelligence parameters
4. WHEN search quality is evaluated THEN it SHALL meet minimum quality thresholds
5. WHEN PDF generation fails THEN the system SHALL handle exceptions gracefully
6. WHEN analysis components are missing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages

### Requirement 7: Fix End-to-End Integration Issues

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want end-to-end workflows to complete successfully, so that the entire patent analysis pipeline functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring workflow performance THEN the system SHALL include peak_memory_mb metric
2. WHEN workflows execute end-to-end THEN they SHALL complete with success status
3. WHEN agent collaboration occurs THEN it SHALL handle failures and recovery properly
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL pass validation for all components
